The registration slots for renewing drivers licenses are randomly opened during the day.

This code allows you to automatically fill in the form and get to the recaptcha box, and then gives you control to continue from that point.

The idea was to overcome the recaptcha and have this utility go all the way through to check for open slots and then make a booking if available, otherwise loop and try again.
